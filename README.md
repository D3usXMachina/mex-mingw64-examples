# C, C++ and Fortran mex examples

Matlab MEX examples written in C, C++, and Fortran that can be compiled using MinGW64 (using C/C++ Fortran interoperability for Fortran).

Currently this repository hosts five different examples of mex functions combining "gateway"-routines written in C or C++ with "compute"-routines written in C, C++ and Fortran. The folder names for each example follows the naming convention <compute-lang>-<gateway-lang>-mex.
